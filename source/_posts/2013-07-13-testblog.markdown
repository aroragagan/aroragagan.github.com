# Octopress Installation
[Octopress][octopress] is a blogging framework built on top of [Jekyll][jekyll] to let you generate and deploy your blog in a few minutes. Here are the steps to follow on Fedora 19:

{% codeblock Octopress installation lang:bash %} 
$ yum install git
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash
$ . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
$ rvm install 1.9.3
$ rvm rubygems latest
$ rvm use 1.9.3 --default
$ rvm reload
$ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git myblog
$ cd myblog
$ ruby -v #should be 1.9.3 otherwise octopress would not install
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rake install #install the default octopress theme
{% endcodeblock %}

# Deploying Octopress to [github] [github]
gitgub allows you to publish pages for free. There are two types of pages you can publish: 
1. User & Organisation pages
2. Project pages

## Deploying  to User & organisation pages

To deploy these you will have to create a repository on github with your username: `username.github.io` or organisation name: `organisation.github.io`. Once you have done this you can tell octopress to setup and deploy the pages to your repository as given below:

{% codeblock Deploying to User/Organisation pages lang:bash %}
$ rake setup_github_pages
# provide your github pages repository url
# this will setup github pages repository as the default origin remote
# change the active branch from master to source
# setup the blog url according to repository
# setup a master branch in _deploy directory for deployment

$ rake generate 
$ rake deploy  
{% endcodeblock %}

This will basically generate your blog and copy the generated files to _deploy directory. The generated files will be added to git, commited and pushed to the remote master branch.

Commit the source of your blog:
{% codeblock %}
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "message"
$ git push origin source
{% endcodeblock %}
